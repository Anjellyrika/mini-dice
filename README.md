## ðŸ’œ A short introduction...
I started creating **Mini Dice** with the goal of learning ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rust-%23e43717?style=flat-square&logo=Rust&logoColor=%23000000). I wanted to integrate a simple interface with the help of the [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui) library to provide a smooth experience for users.
<br>
The app is *fully-functional*, but I'm still looking to add more features in the future! I am a big fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPG), specifically [Pathfinder 2e](https://paizo.com/pathfinder), and I aim to turn this little dice roller into a multipurpose tool for TTRPG players to use.

## ðŸ”¨ How to run the app
The app is built with the Rust package manager, Cargo. Simply run the command:
```
cargo run --release
```
