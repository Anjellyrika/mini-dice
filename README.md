:purple_heart: I started creating **Mini Dice** with the goal of learning Rust and using a Rust library. The app is *fully-functional*, but I'm still looking to add more features in the future! I am a big fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPG), specifically [Pathfinder 2e](https://paizo.com/pathfinder), and I aim to turn this little dice roller into a multipurpose tool for TTRPG players to use.
